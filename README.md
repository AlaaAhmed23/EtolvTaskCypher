Below is a **template for documentation** tailored to the **ETOLV TASK** repository at [AlaaAhmed23/EtolvTaskCypher](https://github.com/AlaaAhmed23/EtolvTaskCypher). Since I cannot directly access private repositories or external content, this template assumes a typical Task structure based on common features (e.g., Subject management, student enrollment, reporting). Adjust the details to match your actual project.
